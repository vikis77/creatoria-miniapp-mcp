/**
 * Capabilities Module - New Architecture Entry Point
 *
 * Each capability (automator, miniprogram, page, element, etc.) is a self-contained module:
 * - schemas/: Zod schema definitions for tool inputs
 * - handlers/: Handler implementations
 * - index.ts: CapabilityModule export with tools array
 *
 * The ToolRegistry provides centralized tool management and the loader
 * dynamically loads and registers capabilities with the MCP server.
